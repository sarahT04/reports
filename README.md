# Website detail

[[LINK]](https://reports-saraht04.vercel.app/)

There are 2 landing pages for this website, namely '/authentication' for users who are not logged in (users must log in first to be able to use the website) and '/' where there are 4 buttons available.

A user who is an admin can access the admin section of the website and do admin configurations and do all the things a normal user can do.

Users who are not admins can write reports and read reports that have been made.

In writing a report, there are 4 form fields that must be filled in, class name (already added beforehand), class date and time, student name, and any comments they have. The 3 optional form-fields are for writing the student's weaknesses, strengths, and what can be improved.

In viewing reports, users can see the reports they have created. The 'Load More' feature is available on reports.

On the admin website, admins can view reports from class information or from the coach name. Admin can also add class names.
